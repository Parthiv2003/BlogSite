                    <h1> Security Vulnerability in Web Application Framework </h1>
                    <br> 
                    <p class="expl"> Web applications are one of the most common targets for hacking because they provide easy access to a wider audience, allowing malicious code to spread faster. But, alas, many companies seriously think about cybersecurity services only after the incident has already occurred. <br> <br>
                        <strong style="font-size: 22px;"> Why are Web Applications So Vulnerable to Attacks?</strong> <br> 
                        Web apps can be attacked for various reasons, including system flaws resulting from incorrect coding, misconfigured web servers, application design flaws, or failure to validate forms. Any web application has at least one vulnerability that hackers can exploit at a higher level. <br> Such weaknesses or vulnerabilities allow criminals to gain direct and public access to databases that contain valuable information, making them a frequent target of attacks. <br> <br>
                        <strong style="font-size: 22px;"> Top 10 Vulnerabilities: </strong>
